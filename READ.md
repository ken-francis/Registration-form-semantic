# Semantic HTML Registration Form

## Project Description
This project is a semantic HTML5 implementation of a user registration form.  
The form demonstrates proper structure, accessibility, and semantic markup.  

## Purpose
The form collects:
- Personal information (name, email, gender)
- Account details (username, password)
- Contact and address
- Additional info and file upload
- User consent  

## File Structure
- `index.html` → Contains the semantic HTML registration form  
- `README.md` → Project documentation  

## How to View
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.  
2. Or in Codespaces, right-click the file and choose **Open with Live Server**.  

## Notes
- All fields use `<label>` for accessibility.  
- Required fields use `required` for HTML validation.  
- `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` group related inputs for semantic meaning.
